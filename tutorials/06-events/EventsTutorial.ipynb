    "Welcome to the event handling tutorial for the new OpenGL api of PySide2.\n",
    "\n",
    "By event handling we mean two things: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Acquiring the user input through the aid of other widgets and displaying its effect on scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Responding to a state of scene with respect to a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to see an example of the first one in this tutorial. \n",
    "For the second one, remember that once a scene is drawn it is as good as gone, because the main use of OpenGL is rendering objects on scene not changing their state.\n",
    "It is possible to do computation on OpenGL of course and we shall see an example in the next tutorial while dealing with light effects, but it is better to do critical computation at the client code rather than in OpenGL.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also evident in the `qt` api as well. \n",
    "Simply look at the amount of setters with respect to that of getters, if they exist at all. \n",
    "Qt also favors a mindset where you send stuff for rendering only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see our final application window, where we finally start to use some of the handles that we had defined from the beginning."
