    "Why draw a cube ? So far we had seen only 2d rendering. \n",
    "A cube introduces us to 3d rendering in OpenGL. \n",
    "With respect to 2d rendering it introduces several additional configurations that need to be taken into account which are tied to the very nature of 3d objects. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3d objects are contained in a 3d world.\n",
    "- 3d objects are observed from somewhere inside the world.\n",
    "- Observation process transforms the 3d object to a 2d object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now these three facts obliges to use three additional objects in shaders to render a 3d object:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **model** matrix 4x4: determines the position of the object in a 3d world\n",
    "- **view** matrix 4x4: transforms the coordinates of objects in a 3d world with respect to the camera/viewer position\n",
    "- **projection** matrix 4x4: determines how object(s) would appear with respect to the position and the direction of the viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be more or less clear that 3d rendering needs a little more consideration and effort. \n",
